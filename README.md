# Stochastic-Whitening-Batch-Normalization
This repository contains the implementation of the Stochastic Whitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) layer in tensorflow, developed for the Neural Networks exam at Universit√† degli studi di Roma La Sapienza.\
In this code the SWBN layer is inserted in a ResNetV2-56 and compared with classical batch normalization in the same structure. A short report is available where results are reported.\
The SWBN method is introduced in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04413 and explained by one of the authors in this seminar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxiBG4dMB2k&ab_channel=GERADRecherche
